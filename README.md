What's for Dinner?

This is a fun app I made to help answer the age-old question: “What are we eating tonight?"
It’s built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it randomly picks a restaurant in Indiana, pa.

Function

- Click a button, get one or two choices on restaurants.
- It’s a small, fun project I put together while learning JavaScript.

Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

How to use it

1. Download or clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click around and see what’s for dinner

No setup or server needed — it runs straight in the browser.

Stuff I might add later

- The ability to add have more than two choices
- Cleaner UI, maybe even a mobile-friendly version
